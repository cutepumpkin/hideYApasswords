**Save and Encrypt Passwords and obviously Decrypt Passwords when neended**


Made this program so that it'll be easier for me to remember the passwords by saving the passwords with some security
if another user opens the txt file.


* **Used datastructure Dictionary<TKey, TValue>** to save every alphabetical and numeric character's key. 

* **Used LINQ** to search in dictionary for decrypting or encrypting 


passcode is 098 

you can change the passcode, that is in Program.cs.
